					Causes of climate change in our country
				</h1>
				<p>
					Our task in the first week was to think about the causes of climate change in Poland.  We created a presentation that had 10 slides. In it, we described the temperature anomalies in our country and the main causes of climate change, such as: deforestation, increasing livestock farming, energy based on fossil fuels, transport or industry and the related realese of large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. We also took some photos showing greenhouse gases emission.

				<h1>
					Just Do It!
				</h1>
				<p>
					In the second week, we talked about the effects of climate change.  We created a presentation and we came up with the idea to plant a tree in the school yard.  We chose a small weeping willow tree.  We dug a hole and recorded a video in which we shouted our slogan: "JD JUST DO IT: SAVE THE PLANET"
